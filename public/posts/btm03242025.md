# How *Bottoms* Breaks the Rules of Queer Storytelling  

Hollywood often writes queer characters as **morally perfect, deeply tragic,** or **tokenized side characters**. *Bottoms* completely rejects these conventions by making its leads, PJ and Josie, **absolute disasters**. They lie, manipulate, and start a fight club for entirely selfish reasons—yet, they’re still likable because they feel real.  

Unlike many mainstream queer films that **sanitize their characters** to avoid controversy, *Bottoms* embraces messiness, proving that queer leads don’t have to be role models to be entertaining. Their queerness isn’t treated as a **defining struggle** or a **political statement**—it just *is*, which feels refreshing in a media landscape that often **over-explains identity**.  

## Queer Films Aren’t Just About Romance  

Another major way *Bottoms* flips expectations is by **refusing to center its story around romance**. Many queer films overemphasize love stories, as if a queer-led movie must justify its existence through relationships.  

While PJ and Josie do have crushes, the real emotional core of the film is their **chaotic, co-dependent friendship**. *Bottoms* values **queer friendships** in a way that most mainstream media ignores, showing that LGBTQ+ characters can have stories that aren’t just about falling in love.  

## A Satirical Take on Hollywood Feminism  

The movie also takes a sharp jab at Hollywood’s favorite version of feminism—the polished, **girlboss-style empowerment** seen in films like *Barbie* and *Legally Blonde*.  

Instead of offering an inspiring message about self-improvement, *Bottoms* starts with a completely **shallow premise**:  

> PJ and Josie lie about knowing how to fight to impress their crushes.  

However, as the film progresses, the **fake fight club** unexpectedly turns into something real, giving the other girls in school an outlet for **genuine power and self-expression**.  

This chaotic, almost **accidental version of empowerment** is a sharp contrast to the kind of **marketable, corporate-friendly feminism** that Hollywood often promotes. The film **mocks** the idea that empowerment has to look a certain way while still celebrating the ways that **rebellion—no matter how ridiculous—can create real change**.  

## The Beauty of Unhinged, Queer Chaos  

Ultimately, *Bottoms* is a **middle finger** to Hollywood’s safe, digestible queer storytelling. It doesn’t attempt to be a **prestige drama** or a **sanitized feel-good movie**—it’s **dumb, violent, absurd, and unapologetically fun**.  

Instead of treating queerness as something delicate that needs to be handled with care, the movie throws it into a world of **blood, sweat, and total chaos**.  

By rejecting the traditional queer movie formula, *Bottoms* carves out its own space as a **refreshingly irreverent, aggressively unserious, and unexpectedly smart satire**. It proves that sometimes, the best kind of representation **isn’t respectable at all**—it’s **messy, unhinged, and ridiculously fun to watch**.
